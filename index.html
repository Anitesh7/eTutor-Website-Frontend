                <p class="sectionSubTag textsmall">During the period 1991-97, the north-eastern states have shown a
                    significant improvement in the literacy rates (7+ and 15+ population). It may be noted that 1991
                    literacy rates (census) are based on complete enumeration while the 1997 rates are generated by the
                    NSSO based on the household sample survey i.e. 52nd round. During the period, both the rural/urban
                    and male/female differential in literacy have declined. In 1997, Mizoram recorded the highest
                    literacy (95 per cent) followed by Nagaland (84 per cent), Meghalaya (77 per cent), Manipur (76 per
                    cent), Assam (75 per cent) and Tripura (73 per cent).The male/female differential is also lowest in
                    Mizoram (1 per cent) and highest in Arunachal Pradesh (21 per cent). Quite a similar trend has also
                    been noticed in case of 15 + literacy rate.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag textsmall">Bihar has been a major centre of learning and home to one of the
                    oldest universities of one of the earliest universities of India dating back to the fifth century
                    and the tradition of learning which had its origin from ancient times was lost during the medieval
                    period when it is believed that marauding armies of the invaders destroyed these centres of
                    learning.After a series of reforms and steps taken by BSEB such as interviewing toppers before
                    releasing results, the pass percentage has increased considerably. In 2020, 80.44% students who had
                    appeared for class 12 BSEB examination were declared passed. Similarly, for class 10, the pass
                    percentage for 2020 examination improved to 80.59%. To increase the pass percentage, the pattern of
                    examination was also changed with MCQs playing a key role in this improvement</p>

                <p class="sectionTag textbig">Education in Rajasthan</p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag textsmall">Education plays a massive role in enhancing the human capital of the
                    population and results in individuals and society achieving high rates of invention and innovation
                    (Hanushek, 2005). In India, over a million schools are run by governments (UDISE, 2016). Even with
                    the country having one of the largest public-school education systems in the world, the literacy
                    rate stands at only 74 percent. Further, the government’s ability to achieve high rates of
                    enrolment, primarily as a result of the implementation of the Right to Education Act, is yet to
                    translate into high learning outcomes. As established by the World Development Report 2018,
                    ‘schooling’ is not the same as ‘learning’ and a core concern in the Indian education reality is just
                    that.</p>
